# Twitter Tamer - a browser extension

A browser extension to eliminate some of the noise on Twitter. ~~It's available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-distraction-remov/aflapchiclhldkgbbahbdionenmhkoed), which means it should work with Brave and Opera too.~~

---

When the extension is first installed, nothing is selected, so nothing is hidden. Open the "options" page and choose the elements you'd like to hide, such as:

- Left column items _(i.e. "Notifications" or "Lists")_
- Right column items _(i.e. "Who to Follow" or "Trends")_
- Reactions to tweets _(i.e. "likes" and "retweets")_
- Media _(i.e. images and videos)_
- Ads _(i.e. those annoying "Promotion" tweets)_
- ... and more

~~If you have a question or problem, [open an issue](https://github.com/grantwinney/twitter-tamer/issues) on GitHub.~~
